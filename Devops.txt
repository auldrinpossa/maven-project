user,group,other

Serveice - identity and access management - iam

one user can be part of multiple groups. (group cannot be part of other group) - q. what is iam user and group
user can log in, group cannot.

ssh port - 22 (unix)
RDP - 3389 (Windows)
http- 80 https-443
smtp - 25

security gorups: virtual firewall rules  where we need to define inbound/ outbound rules.
security group can be applied only EC2 level.
there is no deny rule.

Load Balancer types
1. Appln load balancer (for  applications) -- http/https request, OSI layer 7
2. Network '' (high bandwidth) -- OSI layer 4, tcp
3. Classic '' (For EC2 Instance) -- OSI layer 4, http/https/tcp

Auto scalling -> based on parameter -> 1.CPU 2. Memory (eg. cpu>80% and for 1 miniute then create instance automatically)
How can we attached files to automatically created instance?








jenkin

Whatever we installed Java/Maven/Jenkin, is it for Ec2 instance each
Do you have complete diagram which explains the entier process till deployment to production server? (In real case )
Developer -> check in changes -> GitHub -> Genkin Server-> Selenium -> Prod Server 
What is real case scenario. Is Jenkin set to check each commit and then build the code or set for periodic check and then build?
If Yes - what if build is taking 5 mins to build source code?
How to rollback changes of a user if build fails?
Are we going to test example with success and failiure notification?



Create Jenkin job
|
Maven - get url from github proj (clone..)
provide url to jenkin


What is upstream and downstream

why 2 jobs required.


Master - Slave
